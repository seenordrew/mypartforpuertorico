        <p>Our first delivery was small - six packages of new underwear to a family in San Sebastián that lost their home and all its contents. Our most recent delivery was to Félix Seijó School, a refuge site for families in the municipality of Utuado in the central mountain range of the island. We took a carload of clothing items along with provisions we were able to purchase in San Juan, including gallon jugs of drinking water, Pediasure, Ensure, nuts, raisins, dry cereal, fruit punch, canned meats, and diapers.<br><br>

Future targeted communities include: Adjuntas, Barranquitas, Comerío, Guayama, Jayuya and Las Marías. Every day on the radio we continue to hear pleas for essential goods from these communities along with reports about goods sitting at the docks awaiting paperwork to release and deliver them. Current weather conditions are bringing more floods and the urgency for delivery does not stop. We welcome your donation and will quickly put it to use directly helping families in need.</p>

<h3>Monday October 16, 2017</h2>

<p>We would like to report that today, Monday October 16, we made a delivery to the people of the mountain municipality of Adjuntas. We want to thank all of you that through your contributions made this possible. After just a couple days of being online we received enough contributions for a robust delivery of much needed goods to Casa Pueblo, a community-based initiative under the founding and direction of Alexis Massol, recipient of the internationally recognized Goldman Award for his decades of extraordinary service toward human rights and environmental concerns. Families in the community can receive provisions from Casa Pueblo in two ways: those who have the means to get to the center of town - some are still going by horse - receive packages there; otherwise, the team at Casa Pueblo has vehicles that can make the delivery direct to homes that are inaccessible by roads.<br><br>We'd like to highlight that the center is a model of community outreach. It is completely solar energized so we were witness to its offering of a reliable space to community members who need power to operate medical therapeutic  devices.<br><br> It's been nearly a month since Hurricane Maria, and flash floods continue to cause landslides, bridge failures and home damage. Today was one of those days. With your help we look forward to making our next trip later this week.</p><br>
