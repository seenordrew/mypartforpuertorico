      <h3>Saturday October 21, 2017</h3>

      <p>Thanks to your contributions over the past week, on Saturday Oct. 21 we were able to make a return trip to the mountainous municipality of Adjuntas. We were extremely fortunate to be joined by family and friends who filled an additional five cars with essential goods which they had donated themselves or received from local merchants.</p>

      <p>As a team of sixteen people, we expanded our efforts and offered multiple services:<p>

      <ul>
        <li>Directly delivered bottled water, sugar, rice, care packages of mixed food supplies and warm hugs of solidarity to dozens of families living in destroyed or badly damaged homes in the more remote barrios of Vegas Arriba, Garzas and Altos de Cuba.</li>
        <li>Served a scrumptious hot paella meal to approximately 250 people, thanks to the generous donation of time and talent by renowned Puerto Rican chef Efraín Cruz.</li>
        <li>Provided 400 ham and cheese sandwiches freshly made and donated by the World Central Kitchen project that has been set up here in San Juan.</li>
        <li>Added a large supply of items such as bottled water, nonperishable food and diapers to the inventory that is available to the families who are able to come to Casa Pueblo for these essential goods.</li>
        <li>Provided over-the-counter medical supplies for use by physicians in the community who provide services to the remote areas.</li>
        <li>Distributed water filters to be shared by a large segment of the community.</li>
        <li>Gave solar bulbs donated by Casa Pueblo to several homes.</li>
        <li>Transported a car full of donated clothes items from Casa Pueblo to the Baptist Church in Adjuntas so those items could be included in their Saturday free market open to all community members.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>With this weekend's experience we can affirm that post-María the island remains in a state of emergency with many of the mountainous areas still looking for ways to obtain essential goods. Large supply trucks cannot travel the narrow roads so many people have not received any assistance from government entities. This makes the work by local initiatives such as My Part for Puerto Rico all the more urgent. Thank you for making this effort possible!! Please share our continued need with your friends and family.</p>

      <h3>Monday October 16, 2017</h3>

      <p>We would like to report that today, Monday October 16, we made a delivery to the people of the mountain municipality of Adjuntas. We want to thank all of you that through your contributions made this possible. After just a couple days of being online we received enough contributions for a robust delivery of much needed goods to Casa Pueblo, a community-based initiative under the founding and direction of Alexis Massol, recipient of the internationally recognized Goldman Award for his decades of extraordinary service toward human rights and environmental concerns.<br><br>

      Families in the community can receive provisions from Casa Pueblo in two ways: those who have the means to get to the center of town - some are still going by horse - receive packages there; otherwise, the team at Casa Pueblo has vehicles that can make the delivery direct to homes that are inaccessible by roads.<br><br>

      We'd like to highlight that the center is a model of community outreach. It is completely solar energized so we were witness to its offering of a reliable space to community members who need power to operate medical therapeutic devices.<br><br>

      It's been nearly a month since Hurricane Maria, and flash floods continue to cause landslides, bridge failures and home damage. Today was one of those days. With your help we look forward to making our next trip later this week.</p>

      <h3>October 4, 2017</h3>
      <p>Our most recent delivery was to Félix Seijó School, a refuge site for families in the municipality of Utuado in the central mountain range of the island. We took a carload of clothing items along with provisions we were able to purchase in San Juan, including gallon jugs of drinking water, Pediasure, Ensure, nuts, raisins, dry cereal, fruit punch, canned meats, and diapers.<br><br>

      Future targeted communities include: Adjuntas, Barranquitas, Comerío, Guayama, Jayuya and Las Marías. Every day on the radio we continue to hear pleas for essential goods from these communities along with reports about goods sitting at the docks awaiting paperwork to release and deliver them. Current weather conditions are bringing more floods and the urgency for delivery does not stop. We welcome your donation and will quickly put it to use directly helping families in need.</p>

      <p>We started small. Our first delivery was six packages of new underwear to a family in San Sebastián that lost their home and all its contents.</p>
