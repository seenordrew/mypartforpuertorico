<!-- Purpose -->

        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>Family and friends have asked how they can help Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane María.  We are offering this single-stop site so you can make contributions that will go 100% directly to families in urgent need of basic goods. While federal and insular agencies are doing what they understand is best, political and bureaucratic protocols unintentionally obstruct the timely delivery of the most basic goods, including water and food.<br><br>  

In the wake of the hurricane, Puerto Rico was left without a telecommunication system and many areas with little to no roadway access. Moving about the island in our efforts to ascertain the well-being of own family members, we have witnessed the devastation that has affected the entire population, in particular the more remote rural and mountainous regions.<br><br>

	  <img class="right-image" src="images/road-damage2.jpg">
        </div>

Knowing the island and its roads well, we have been successful in putting basic goods directly into the hands of families in this region. We feel fortunate to be in a position to reach some of the most isolated communities on the island and will continue to do so, but with your support we will be able to do so much more.</p>

          <img class="image" src="images/water-filling.jpg">

        <h1>Objectives</h1>
	<ul>
          <li>Collect and use 100% of monetary contributions to purchase basic goods for families in need</li>
          <li>Eliminate the obstruction of bureaucratic protocols that hinder timely delivery of basic goods</li>
          <li>Ensure that your contribution is delivered directly to families and communities most in need</li>
          <li>Facilitate local private citizen initiatives in the identification, acquisition and expeditious delivery of basic goods</li>

         <p> Why we will collect monetary contributions and not goods:
In the face of urgent needs, sending goods is not an effective or efficient means to contribute to recovery. USPS and other shipment options remain limited and slow. Additionally, shipping fees undermine the cost effectiveness of your contribution. Via this account, all contributions will go 100% to the purchase of basic goods. Should you wish to know more about the specific use of your contribution, please contact us at <a href="mailto:'mypartforpuertorico@gmail.com'">mypartforpuertorico@gmail.com.</a><br><br>

Our target population:
More than two weeks after Hurricane María made landfall on Puerto Rico, thousands of people remain housed in emergency shelters. In addition to these families, a substantial part of the population in the more remote areas remain in their homes without roofs, walls or windows. The lack of basic goods, including water and food, has forced many people in these regions of the island to use sources of water that are contaminated with carcasses of dogs, cats and livestock killed by the storm. 

It is evident these conditions are putting this population at high risk of illness. As such, there remains an urgent need for potable water. Healthy water is available in the more urban areas of Puerto Rico, yet access to this supply is hindered by the bureaucratic processes. This same reality applies to other basic items, such as food, diapers, items of personal hygiene and clothing. We are readily able to purchase and deliver these necessities to some communities of this vulnerable population.</p>

        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>We are José and Sheila and we live in the San Juan metropolitan area. José’s maternal family comes from the central mountainous region of Puerto Rico (Utuado), so we have experienced first-hand the devastation of some of the areas we have mentioned. José is a professor at the University of Puerto Rico and Sheila is a former school administrator from Ecuador and the Galápagos. Both of us have a long history of work with community-based initiatives and are committed to assuring that your contribution will be shared at the points of greatest need. We would be honored to be the messenger of your solidarity.</p>
